# Voice-Assistant-Using-Chat-GPT-API
Integrate speech recognition (SpeechRecognition) for input, send text to GPT API (OpenAI's wrapper), process response, and convert it to speech using text-to-speech libraries (like pyttsx3) in Python. This creates a voice assistant enabling seamless interaction via voice commands.
